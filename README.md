# OD-predict
In this project we use traffic flow data to predict the O-D matrix. 

# Files description

- data_simuation.ipynb

> A notebook for generating dataset. 
The main artifacts given from running this file are flows.csv and trips.csv
Also generate a lot of auxiliary files into the folder simulation_data

- od_prediction.ipynp 

>A sandbox for different approaches to OD prediction.
Running through does not make sense. Use sections of this notebook to check hypotheses
A brief overview of this file:
> - *Data generation:* contains old approach to generating data (naive and totally artificial) and generating via SUMO (a dedicated notebook should be used now)
> - *Data from SUMO emulation:* reading data from flows.csv and trips.csv generated by the notebook above
> - *Origin and destination Model architecture*, *Origin prediction*, *Destination prediction* are the sections to apply the "two-steps" approach
> - *Final model architecture:* a model that contributes results of the previous predictions; also can be used independently as the "one-step" approach
> - *Predictions:* Test models

- od_prediction.py

> Basically, it is the *final model architecture* section combined as a executable
